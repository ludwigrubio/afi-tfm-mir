# Music genre classification based on Music Information Retrieval

This repository contain all files used for final project __TFM__
 on __Afi - Escuela de finanzas__ master degree in  __Data science & Big Data (2018-2019)__.


## Organization

* __initial-proposal__: Documents of initial idea of the project.

* __papers__: Free papers used as inspiration for the project.

* __tfm-mir__: 
	
	* _app-deep-learning_: Code of APP of real time classification genre.
	
	* _fma-outputs_: Code to build meta-data, create MIR features and train ML algorithms and ensemble for classification,
	including descriptive analysis. 
	
	* _planning_: Code of planning time for the project in R.


## Execution

_Python_:

* To execute code successfully, load the file __tfm-mir/environment_mir.yml__ in Anaconda to install all needed dependencies for python.

* To re-compile APP data and models, load the file __tfm-mir/environment_dl.yml__ in Anaconda to install all needed dependencies for python, and follow
instruction on README.md inside __tfm-mir/app-deep-learning__ folder. A _docker_ version is available to run web app.

_R_:

Just run .R files.
