2. _creation.py_: File to create metada files .csv

3. _features.py_: File to calculate and organize all data recovered with MIR techniques.

4. _utils.py_: File with definition of general function nedded in other scripts and notebooks files.

## Notebooks

1. _Exploration and cleaning_: Visualization of all files used in the followed notebooks, missing values clean process.

2. _Descriptive analysis_: Detailed descriptive analysis of metadata, technical parametrs on music files and features builded with MIR tecniques. 

3. _Machine learning_: All selection variables process and selection algorithms to build and ensemble.
